Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning

◆ Applied dropout and early stopping on “deep dream”; fine-tuned the transfer learning using MobileNet to classify flower images.

◆ Trained LSTM networks with embedding to predict text and Transformers with encoder and decoder to translate English-Spanish.

◆ Implemented (ε-)Greedy, Thompson sampling, and gradient bandit on 5-armed bandit to show reward, regret, and Explore-Exploit.

◆ Employed Value Iteration and MCES policy on Blackjack; tackled cartpole problem with Deep Q Network and experience replay.
